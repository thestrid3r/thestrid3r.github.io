        I'm a DevOps engineer with {experience} of experience shaping cloud-native infrastructure, security-first architectures, and resilient DevOps ecosystems.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        I have scaled secure, high-availability platforms across AWS and GCP, led Kubernetes-driven modernization initiatives, and architected compliant multi-cloud environments adhering to PCI DSS, ISO, and NIST standards.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        I believe infrastructure is not just about uptime — it's a catalyst for business agility, security, and innovation. I specialize in designing scalable, cost-optimized platforms that empower engineering teams to move faster with confidence.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        My leadership philosophy is simple: build systems that are resilient by design, automate relentlessly, and infuse security at every layer — all while mentoring teams to think boldly and engineer for the future.
